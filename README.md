# My Microsoft Excel Data Analysis Project

## Salary Analysis Data Job
As someone exploring a career change and learning new skills to land my first job in data, 
I analyzed the most required skills for securing a job or an entry level position using Dax.
I have also analyzed the pay range for various data positions.
I analyzed the correlation between the number of skills and the pay range using Power Query.
